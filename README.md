## Plan on improving the project

Add your ideas here :)

I think a great way to improve the styling to this project and to help use this project on a portfolio would be to have a diffrent header structure than the first project. While I do think it is a good idea for students to be able to refferance the first project to help get started on project 2, perhaps changing the background colors to be a reverse gradient to the footer to give the webpage a fluid apperance.
